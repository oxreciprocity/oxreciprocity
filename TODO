## Security
- TODO: Add hashing for ids
  - though not really sensitive information since application-scoped?
- TODO: Find another csrf package 
- TODO: Check SQL injection not possible
- TODO: Enable HTTPS
- MAYBE: After someone's created an account, they don't really need to log in using their MSID -
  maybe there's a quicker flow with only FB auth?

## UI
- TODO: Build logic to get names+profile pictures(+profile urls?) from Facebook
- TODO: Build UI (post-auth flow)

## Before production
- TODO: add the non-development redirect URIs to: .env, auth/*.js files, in applications
  - for MS, in authentication > redirect URIs
  - for FB, in use cases > customise > settings
- TODO: Build actual tests

## Features
- TODO: reminder when X friends have signed up
- TODO: Build rate limiter to prevent spam
  - If we only display one match at a time, we should make sure that both A and B are presented with that match

## Code tidiness
- TODO: file structure, use of controllers, auth routers (e.g. auth/index.js)
