      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Oxreciprocity is a platform to find matches - romantic or platonic.
        You check boxes, your friends do the same, and we'll let you know when the feeling's mutual.
        You can check boxes on up to three people per week, and find out whether it's a match right away.</p>
